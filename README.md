This is code associated with:
Squires S, Bennett AP, Niranjan M. A variational autoencoder for probabilistic non-negative matrix factorisation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05912. 2019 Jun 13.

The functions here allow for PAE-NMF to be run. They were written in an older version of PyTorch. They will be updated at some point.
